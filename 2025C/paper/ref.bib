  abstract = {ABSTRACT Objective To compare the differences in levator ani muscle biometry and hiatal dimensions between pregnant nulliparous Caucasian and East Asian women. Methods Offline analysis of three/four-dimensional ultrasound volume data obtained from two groups of pregnant nulliparous women, Caucasian and East Asian, was performed. Volume acquisition was performed in the late third trimester using the same method in both groups, in the context of two prospective observational studies with identical entry criteria. Pelvic organ descent and levator hiatal dimensions were assessed using the volumes acquired on Valsalva maneuver, and pubovisceral muscle thickness was measured from the volumes obtained on pelvic floor muscle contraction (PFMC). Results Datasets of 200 East Asian and 168 Caucasian women were analyzed. Compared with Caucasian women, East Asian women had a significantly lower body mass index. All indices of pelvic organ descent were significantly higher in the Caucasian group than in the East Asian group. The difference, expressed as a percentage, in levator hiatal area on both Valsalva maneuver and PFMC was markedly greater in Caucasian (32\% vs 19\%; P < 0.001) than in East Asian (24\% vs 20\%; P = 0.01) women. After controlling for potential confounders using multivariate regression analysis, racial origin remained the only significant factor associated with differences in pelvic organ descent and hiatal dimensions. The thickness and area of pubovisceral muscle were significantly higher in the East Asian group. Conclusions Pregnant women of East Asian racial origin have a thicker pubovisceral muscle, smaller hiatus and less mobility of pelvic organs than do pregnant Caucasian women. Copyright © 2014 ISUOG.

  abstract  = {Massively parallel sequencing of DNA molecules in the plasma of pregnant women has been shown to allow accurate and noninvasive prenatal detection of fetal trisomy 21. However, whether the sequencing approach is as accurate for the noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 13 and 18 is unclear due to the lack of data from a large sample set. We studied 392 pregnancies, among which 25 involved a trisomy 13 fetus and 37 involved a trisomy 18 fetus, by massively parallel sequencing. By using our previously reported standard z-score approach, we demonstrated that this approach could identify 36.0% and 73.0% of trisomy 13 and 18 at specificities of 92.4% and 97.2%, respectively. We aimed to improve the detection of trisomy 13 and 18 by using a non-repeat-masked reference human genome instead of a repeat-masked one to increase the number of aligned sequence reads for each sample. We then applied a bioinformatics approach to correct GC content bias in the sequencing data. With these measures, we detected all (25 out of 25) trisomy 13 fetuses at a specificity of 98.9% (261 out of 264 non-trisomy 13 cases), and 91.9% (34 out of 37) of the trisomy 18 fetuses at 98.0% specificity (247 out of 252 non-trisomy 18 cases). These data indicate that with appropriate bioinformatics analysis, noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 by maternal plasma DNA sequencing is achievable.},
